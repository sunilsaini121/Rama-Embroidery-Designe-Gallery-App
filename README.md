# Rama-Embroidery-Designe-Gallery-App
An embroidery design e-commerce app with 5,000+ downloads, featuring a simplified UI/UX, Razorpay payment gateway, and Firebase integration.

📌 Overview

I am an embroidery designer, and after some time I decided to create an embroidery design app. I started with research, studied other apps for reference, and worked with a developer to bring my idea to life.

Initially, the app had poor UI/UX and a weak logo, but over time I improved it with feedback, better design, simplified login, and reliable payment solutions. The app has now crossed 5000+ downloads on Play Store.
